# Here Lies Puggerbot

This is a chat bot I wrote for Discord to perform utility functions for my
friends and I and to keep myself programming. Over time, he became used more as
an interface for a Dungeons and Dragons database.

I attempted to rewrite Puggerbot in JavaScript using NodeJS, but struggled due
to design problems. The largest problem by far being that a chatbot is one of
the worst interfaces for a database. Before I came to that realization,
Puggerbot was already generating and sending html files in response to database
queries. He became more of a poorly designed website than his original use as a
utility bot.

I doubt that I will return to this project. There are other projects that I
would rather spend my time on, especially since I can't find a good use case for
him. I am more likely use Puggerbot as inspiration for future projects.

Rest In Peace, buddy. You were a good boy.
