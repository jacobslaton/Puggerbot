**Tutorial: Spells Part 1 of 5 - The Basics**
This command is used to get a set of spells from Puggerbot's database that match a certain criteria. This criteria is expressed in what is called a query. The set of spells is packaged inside of an html file and is uploaded to Discord. You can open the html file using any modern web browser.

**Example 1.1**
This is the most basic use of this command.
```>spells```
Since no query is given, Puggerbot returns the set containing all spells. The command `spells` can be shortened to `sp`.
```>sp```

**Example 1.2**
To ask for a specific spell, use the `is` or `==` operator on `name`.
```>sp name is "fireball"```
Note that the spell name doesn't have to be capitalized. Searching for `Fireball`, `fireball`, or `FiReBaLl` will yield the Fireball spell. When searching a field with a words in double quotes, Puggerbot will rarely pay attention to upper or lower case.

**Example 1.3**
To ask for all the spells in a specific class, use the `in` or `contains` operator on `class`.
```>sp class contains "wizard"```
```>sp "Wizard" in class```

**Example 1.4**
To specify the levels of the spells, use the `is`, `==`, or `!=` operator on `level`.
```>sp level is 3```
You can also use `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` to specify a range of levels.
```>sp level <= 3```

**Example 1.5**
For any field that you search, you can add the `not` keyword before it to make it have the opposit effect. This command will give you the set of all spells that are not cantrips.
```>sp not level is 0```
