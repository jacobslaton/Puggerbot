**Tutorial: Roll Part 1 of 3 - The Basics**
**Example 1.1**
This is one of the most basic uses of this command.
```>roll 1d20```
The name `roll` can be shortened to `r`. If you only want to roll one kind of dice, you can omit the "1" that comes before the "d".
```>r d20```
The dice don't have to be actual dice, they can have any number of sides.
```>r 2d13```

**Example 1.2**
You can just do math. You don't have to roll dice.
```>r 1+1```
```>r 7/8```
```>r 2^4```

**Example 1.3**
Both rolling dice and math.
```>r 3d6+d8+4```

**Example 1.4**
Because Discord uses certain characters for formatting, commands with multiple "`*`" may look malformed. To fix this, put a backtick before your command and then a "`#`" followed by another backtick after your command. On American keyboards, the backtick character can be found on the "`~`" key just below the escape key.
`>r 2*d20**4+5**6 #`
